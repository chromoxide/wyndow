A dead simple library for cross-platfrom windows.

The base library with no enabled features offers the following 3 things:
 - A way to initalize a window
 - A way to gather events about a window
 - A way to interact with a window

I want the base library to be as if you were communicating with the os itself but its cross platform.

### Platform Support
- Windows ( Supported )
- MacOs ( Planned for version 1.0 )
- Wayland ( Planned for version 2.0 )
- X11 ( Planned for version 2.x )

### Contributing
